    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano
      cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of black pepper. Italians don't add
      extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if
      you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from
      Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients(One Person)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see
        Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and
        crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the
        boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite,
        about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring
        occasionally, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in
        a bowl until smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly
        cooled. Stir in guanciale.
      </li>
      <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
